================================================================================

Overview:

This data release contains all input datasets used for the analysis described in the associated journal article (Butzler and Klos [2022], see top of ReadMe.txt) as well as the output datasets that were generated from the analysis.

================================================================================

Purpose:

The purpose of this data release is to provide input datasets that were used for the analysis described in the associated journal article (Butzler and Klos. [2022], see top of ReadMe.txt) as well as the output datasets that were generated from the analysis.

================================================================================

Files:

Raw_Nitrate_Values.zip -- CSV file containing raw in-situ nitrate values, latidue and Longitude, associated point, data set collected within, the day mean, standard deviation, normalized value. This data was collected every 50m longitudnally through the Fall Kill Stream. Predictions determined from random forests model (see associated publication for details). 

On-Site_Septic_Systems_in_the_Fall_Kill_Watershed.zip -- Vector dataset describing locations of residnetial on-site septic systems extracted from the Dutchess County Tax Parcel data.   

Interest_Points.zip -- Vector dataset describing the locations that were determined of Interest after in-situ nitrates were collected and varaition in Nitrate level was detmerined. Interest points were used to detmerine Enterococci testing locations (see associated publication for full description)

Fall_Kill_Watershed_NY.zip-- Vector dataset describing the boundary layer of the Fall Kill Watershed, New York. Data derived from  New York State GIS Clearing House. (http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=1294)

Fall_Kill_Stream_and_Tributaries.zip -- Vector dataset describing stream and tributaries within the Fall Kill watershed, Dutchess County, NY.  Data derived from  New York State GIS Clearing House. (http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=1294)

Excessively_Drained_Soils-_Fall_Kill.zip -- Vector dataset describing ecessively drained soils within the Fall Kill Watershed. Data derived from the USDA NRCS (see associated publication for full description. 

Enterococci_Most_Probably_Number_(MPN).zip-- Vector dataset describing locations and their corrsponding enterococci Most Probable Number.
